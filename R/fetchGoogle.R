#' Fetch data from a web service
#'
#' Read a data set generated from a web service such as Google Docs.
#' 
#' @param URL the URL to retrieve a CSV file from the service
#' @param key for convenience, just the "key" part of the Google link
#' 
#' @details
#' Web services such as Google Docs allow you to store spreadsheets
#' "in the cloud".  By setting permissions in the service, you can
#' arrange to make the data set public, so that anyone with an appropriate URL
#' can access the data.
#' Reading such data into R can be done simply if the service supports 
#' exporting the data in a CSV format via URL link.  For instance, 
#' Google Spreadsheets can be set up to publish a spreadsheet via a URL.
#' Unfortunately, the \code{read.csv()} function, although able to read URLs
#' pointing to a file, cannot handle the protocol needed to talk to services such
#' as Google Docs.  \code{fetchGoogle()} allows you to do this.
#' \code{fetchGoogle()} derives its functionality from the RCurl package,
#' which must be installed for the function to work.  RCurl will be loaded 
#' automatically if it is installed.
#' Generating the URL from the web service will, of course, depend on 
#' how that service is set up.  For Google Spreadsheets, you, the owner of a
#' spreadsheet, can
#' (1) open the spreadsheet in a browser
#' (2) select the File/Publish to the Web menu item
#' (3) in the resulting dialog box, press "Start publishing"
#' (4) under "Get a link to the published data", select CSV format
#' (5) copy the \code{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?...} link and post
#' it where your users can get to it.
#' 
#' 
#' @note 
#' The URL must instruct the service to generate a CSV file. The URLs from Google Docs 
#' are very long and contain random-looking sequences.  You may want to 
#' post the URL on a web page whence it can be cut and paste as part of the command.
#' The \code{key=} argument is provided as a convenience so that a shorter
#' character string can be used to refer to a Google document.  Use \code{URL} rather than
#' \code{key} if you are using a non-Google service or if the Google interface
#' changes.
#' \code{fetchData()} expects the spreadsheet to be in a straightforward 
#' rectangular spreadsheet format.
