\usage{
fetchData(name = NULL, show.path = FALSE, add.to.path = NULL,
  drop.from.path = NULL, cache = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{a character string naming a data set.
This will often end in \code{.csv} for reading in a data set.
If it ends in \code{.r} or \code{.R}, the file will be "sourced".}

\item{show.path}{If \code{TRUE}, causes the current search path to be returned}

\item{add.to.path}{Name of a web directory (ending in \code{/}), which
should be pre-pended to the search path.}

\item{drop.from.path}{Name of a web directory to be deleted from the path.}

\item{cache}{If \code{TRUE}, indicates that a data set is to be pre-loaded
into the cached library.  This allows,
for instance, users to pre-load on-line data to be used when they are off-line.}

\item{verbose}{a logical indicating whether additional status messages (e.g., indicating
   where the dataset was located) should be printed.}
}
\value{
a data frame.
}
\description{
\code{fetchData} provides a means for students and others to
locate and load data sets and R commands provided by instructors.
Data can be pre-loaded for off-line sessions, can be positioned
on identified web sites, or loaded from packages.
\code{fetchData} also will load local files using a complete path name (relative
to the current working directory) or, if no name is given, via a dialog box.
}
\details{
There are two major purposes for this function. One is to provide a
consistent interface to reading data: a file name is given and a data frame is
returned, which can be assigned to an object as the user desires.  This
differs from the behavior of \code{data}, which doesn't return a value but
instead creates an object without explicit assignment.

The other purpose is to allow instructors or other group leaders to post data
and R code on
web sites that can be searched as naturally as if the data were on the users'
own machines.  For instance, an instructor might want to post a new data set
just before class, enabling her students to access it in class.

To support this, \code{fetchData} allows new web sites to be added to the
web search path.  Typically, the command to add a site would be in a script
file that is provided to the student that could be run automatically at start
up or \code{source}d over the web.  That is, an instructor might create a
script file stored on a website and, using a web page, provide students with
the text of the command to \code{source} it.

Currently, https addresses are changed to http
