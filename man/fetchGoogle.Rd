\usage{

\item{URL}{the URL to retrieve a CSV file from the service}

\item{key}{for convenience, just the "key" part of the Google link}

\description{
Read a data set generated from a web service such as Google Docs.
}
\details{
Web services such as Google Docs allow you to store spreadsheets
"in the cloud".  By setting permissions in the service, you can
arrange to make the data set public, so that anyone with an appropriate URL
can access the data.
Reading such data into R can be done simply if the service supports
exporting the data in a CSV format via URL link.  For instance,
Google Spreadsheets can be set up to publish a spreadsheet via a URL.
Unfortunately, the \code{read.csv()} function, although able to read URLs
pointing to a file, cannot handle the protocol needed to talk to services such
as Google Docs.  \code{fetchGoogle()} allows you to do this.
\code{fetchGoogle()} derives its functionality from the RCurl package,
which must be installed for the function to work.  RCurl will be loaded
automatically if it is installed.
Generating the URL from the web service will, of course, depend on
how that service is set up.  For Google Spreadsheets, you, the owner of a
spreadsheet, can
(1) open the spreadsheet in a browser
(2) select the File/Publish to the Web menu item
(3) in the resulting dialog box, press "Start publishing"
(4) under "Get a link to the published data", select CSV format
(5) copy the \code{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?...} link and post
it where your users can get to it.
}
\note{
The URL must instruct the service to generate a CSV file. The URLs from Google Docs
are very long and contain random-looking sequences.  You may want to
post the URL on a web page whence it can be cut and paste as part of the command.
The \code{key=} argument is provided as a convenience so that a shorter
character string can be used to refer to a Google document.  Use \code{URL} rather than
\code{key} if you are using a non-Google service or if the Google interface
changes.
\code{fetchData()} expects the spreadsheet to be in a straightforward
rectangular spreadsheet format.
